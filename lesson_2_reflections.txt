What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You initialize git to start tracking commits to the files in the directory.
So you can track your changes, see the difference between the commits and use it as previously discussed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory and repository show all the files in that directory. The staging area allows you to select multiple related files to be staged for a single commit so you don't have to do a commit on each file.
