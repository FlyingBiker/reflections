When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to easily share your work with someone else, maybe someone outside your company where access to your files would be restricted.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may make several commits to your code before it's ready, so it makes more sense to manually push or pull your code when you know it's ready.
