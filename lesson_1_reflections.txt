How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives a list of commit IDs showing the commits made to the code.
git diff shows the changes that occurred between 2 successive commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It's easily allows one to revert back to a working copy if one or more bugs were introduced.  This pretty much takes the fear out of experimenting.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Nothing comes to mind at the moment, though I feel I'm prepared to use and learn more about it moving forward.
